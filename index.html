    <h2>About Me</h2>


    <div class="bio">
      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>Originally born in Farmington, NM, I was raised in Farmington, Durango, Colorado, and Adelaide, South Australia. I moved to Portland Oregon with my family in 1996, and after moving around the country a bit I returned to stay as an adult in 1999. I volunteered for the Army <span class="span">as an Oregonian</span> in 2002, and after being honorably discharged in 2004, I attended Portland State University where I obtained a BA in philosophy in 2005.</p>
      <p>Currently enrolled in Epicodus, I am <em>excited to learn</em> how to program and become a web developer.</p>
