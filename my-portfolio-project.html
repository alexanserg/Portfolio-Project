    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Originally born in Farmington, NM, I was raised in Farmington, Durango, Colorado, and Adelaide, South Australia. I moved to Portland Oregon with my family in 1996, and after moving around the country a bit I returned to stay as an adult in 1999.</p>
    <p>I volunteered for the Army as an Oregonian in 2002, and after being honorably discharged in 2004, I attended Portland State University where I obtained a BA in philosophy in 2005.</p>
    <p>Currently enrolled in Epicodus, I am excited to learn how to program and become a web developer.</p
